# ARIES
Aries Application

This is a web application, developed during my diploma thesis. It is a Javascript-based application built for academic/educational purposes, aimed at providing the fundamental principles and hands-on training to the students. The users may fill the required tables on their own, test their answer's correctness, and also ask for the correct result to be displayed as the solution. It is an educational tool to make sure that the learning of the ARIES algorithm becomes an easier and more enjoyable process, being an application that students can interact with, run as many examples as they wish, and put their own parameters (number of transactions), to adjust the project's complexity and size.
