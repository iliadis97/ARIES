# ARIES
Aries Application

This is a web application, developed during my diploma thesis. It is a Javascript-based application built for academic/educational purposes, aimed at providing the fundamental principles and hands-on training to the students. The user may fill the required tables on his own, test his answer's correctness, and also ask for the correct result to be displayed as the solution. It is an educational tool to make sure that the learning of the ARIES algorithm becomes an easier and more enjoyable process, being an application that the student can interact with, run as many examples as he wishes, and put his own parameters (number of transactions), to adjust the project's complexity and size.
